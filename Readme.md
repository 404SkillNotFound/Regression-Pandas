# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using a dataset of medical attributes. The model utilizes **Linear Regression** for predicting the outcome, with data preprocessing and visualizations included for better understanding.

## Project Overview

This Python script performs the following steps:
1. Loads the heart disease dataset (`heart.csv`).
2. Preprocesses categorical variables by converting them into numeric values.
3. Visualizes the correlation between features.
4. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Trains a Linear Regression model to predict heart disease presence.
6. Evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy score and visualizing the actual vs predicted values.

## Requirements

Before running the script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
